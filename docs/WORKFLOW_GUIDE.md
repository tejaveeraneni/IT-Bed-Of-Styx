# 🚀 Streamlined Development Workflow

## 📋 Available Scripts

### 1. **Auto-Commit Script** (`auto-commit.ps1`)
Automatically commits and pushes all changes in your repository.

```powershell
# Commit with default message
.\auto-commit.ps1

# Commit with custom message
.\auto-commit.ps1 -CommitMessage "Updated issue form fields"
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Checks for changes automatically
- ✅ Stages all files (`git add -A`)
- ✅ Commits with timestamp
- ✅ Pushes to main branch
- ✅ Provides clear status updates

### 2. **File Watcher** (`watch-issue-form.ps1`)
Watches your issue form file and auto-commits changes when you save.

```powershell
# Start watching (runs continuously)
.\watch-issue-form.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- 👀 Monitors `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/user-creation-form.yml`
- 🔄 Auto-commits and pushes when file changes
- ⏰ Adds timestamp to commit messages
- 🛑 Press Ctrl+C to stop watching

### 3. **Quick Deploy** (`quick-deploy.ps1`)
Simple wrapper around auto-commit for quick deployments.

```powershell
# Deploy with custom message
.\quick-deploy.ps1 -CommitMessage "Fixed workflow trigger"
```

## 🔄 Recommended Workflows

### **Option A: Manual Control**
For when you want to commit changes manually:
```powershell
# Make your changes, then:
.\auto-commit.ps1 -CommitMessage "Updated user form with new fields"
```

### **Option B: Automatic Watching** (Recommended)
For continuous development with instant deployment:
```powershell
# Start the watcher in a separate terminal
.\watch-issue-form.ps1

# Now edit your issue form - changes auto-deploy when you save!
```

### **Option C: Quick Deploy**
For fast deployment of any changes:
```powershell
.\quick-deploy.ps1 -CommitMessage "Hotfix for workflow"
```

## 🎯 What We Cleaned Up

**Removed:**
- ❌ `validate-issue-form.ps1` - Unnecessary validation
- ❌ `validate-issue-form.py` - Duplicate Python version
- ❌ `user-onboarding.yml` - Duplicate workflow file

**Streamlined:**
- ✅ One simple auto-commit script
- ✅ File watcher that auto-commits
- ✅ Quick deploy wrapper
- ✅ Single working GitHub Actions workflow

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use the file watcher during development:**
   ```powershell
   .\watch-issue-form.ps1
   # Edit your form, save, and see changes deploy automatically!
   ```

2. **Manual commits for important changes:**
   ```powershell
   .\auto-commit.ps1 -CommitMessage "BREAKING: Changed form field names"
   ```

## 🔧 Current Workflow State

Your GitHub Actions workflow (`create-user.yml`) now:
- ✅ Triggers on issue title containing "Create a New User"
- ✅ Parses form data correctly
- ✅ Runs in demo mode (no Azure auth needed)
- ✅ Creates CSV files for your PowerShell script
- ✅ Posts results back to the issue

**Ready to test!** Create an issue using your form and watch the magic happen! 🎉
